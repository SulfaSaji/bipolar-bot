Dual-Personality System ü§ñ

#ProjectOverview
This project, codenamed Bipolar Bot, is a lighthearted and engaging front-end conversational system. It showcases two distinct and contrasting AI personalities: a positive Compliment Generator and a comically blunt Sarcastic Bot. Built during a one-day hackathon, this project demonstrates how simple array-based logic and minimal front-end technology can be used to create a memorable user experience by playing with extremes in tone and interaction.

#KeyFeatures ‚ú®
Compliment Generator: A module designed to provide a steady stream of uplifting and encouraging remarks.

Sarcastic Bot: A contrasting module that delivers witty, humorous, and playfully blunt retorts.
