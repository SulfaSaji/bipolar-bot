Dual-Personality System ü§ñ
#ProjectOverview
This project, codenamed bipolar-bot, is a lighthearted, array-based conversational system that showcases two contrasting personalities: a positive Compliment Generator and a comically blunt Sarcastic Bot. Built for a one-day hackathon, it highlights how simple front-end technology can create an engaging and memorable user experience by playing with extremes in tone.

#KeyFeatures ‚ú®
Compliment Generator: A module that provides a steady stream of uplifting remarks, designed for cheerful and encouraging feedback.

Sarcastic Bot: A contrasting module that delivers witty, blunt, and humorous retorts, playfully subverting the typical AI persona.

Dynamic UI: The interface changes to reflect each personality, providing a clear visual cue for the user's interaction.

#TechStack üíª

CSS: For all styling, layout, and visual animations.
