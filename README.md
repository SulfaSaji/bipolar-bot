Dual-Personality System 🤖
Project Overview
This project, codenamed Bipolar Bot, is an engaging, front-end conversational system that showcases two distinct AI personalities. It leverages simple array-based logic to create a dynamic user experience, seamlessly switching between a positive Compliment Generator and a comically blunt Sarcastic Bot. Built for a one-day hackathon, this project demonstrates how minimal front-end technology can be used to create a memorable user experience by playing with extremes in tone and interaction.

Key Features ✨
Compliment Generator: A module designed to provide a steady stream of uplifting and encouraging remarks.

Sarcastic Bot: A contrasting module that delivers witty and humorous retorts, subverting the typical AI persona with playful bluntness.

Dynamic UI: The user interface changes dynamically to reflect each personality, providing a clear visual cue that enhances the user's interaction and experience.

Tech Stack 💻
HTML5: Serves as the foundational structure of the project.

CSS3: Handles all styling, layout, and visual animations.

JavaScript: Powers the core conversational and interactive logic of the system.
