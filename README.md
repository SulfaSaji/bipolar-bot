Dual-Personality System ü§ñ
This project is a fun, lighthearted conversational system that showcases two contrasting personalities: an overly positive Compliment Generator and a comically witty Sarcastic Bot. Built for a one-day hackathon, the system demonstrates how a simple, array-based foundation can create engaging and memorable user interactions.

Features ‚ú®
Compliment Generator: A module that provides a steady stream of unique and uplifting remarks. Every interaction is designed to be cheerful and encouraging.

Sarcastic Bot: A contrasting module that delivers comically blunt and witty retorts. Its responses are crafted for humor, playfully poking fun at typical AI politeness.

Array-Based Foundation: Both modules operate on simple and efficient JavaScript arrays, making the content easy to manage and expand.

Technologies Used üíª
HTML: For the project's structure and user interface.

CSS: For styling, layout, and visual effects that bring the personalities to life.

JavaScript: For the core conversational logic, state management, and all interactive elements.
