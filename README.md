# Dual-Personality System ü§ñ

### \#ProjectOverview

This project, codenamed `bipolar-bot`, is a lighthearted, array-based conversational system that showcases two contrasting personalities: a positive Compliment Generator and a comically blunt Sarcastic Bot. Built for a one-day hackathon, it highlights how simple front-end technology can create an engaging and memorable user experience by playing with extremes in tone.
