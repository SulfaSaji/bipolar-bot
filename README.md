Dual-Personality System ü§ñ
Project Overview
This project, codenamed Bipolar Bot, is an engaging, front-end conversational system that showcases two distinct AI personalities. It leverages simple array-based logic to create a dynamic user experience, seamlessly switching between a positive Compliment Generator and a comically blunt Sarcastic Bot. Built for a one-day hackathon, this project demonstrates how minimal front-end technology can be used to create a memorable user experience by playing with extremes in tone and interaction.

#KeyFeatures ‚ú®
Compliment Generator: A module designed to provide a steady stream of uplifting and encouraging remarks.

Sarcastic Bot: A contrasting module that delivers witty and humorous retorts, subverting the typical AI persona with playful bluntness.
